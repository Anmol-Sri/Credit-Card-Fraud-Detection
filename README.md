It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Here you will find the easiest method for detection of fraud credit card.

## Resources Used : 
I have use the data from kaggle (link is here) -> https://www.kaggle.com/isaikumar/creditcardfraud

## Details : 
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression.Throughout
the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being devel-
oped to detect fraudulent transactions. I have build and deployed
the following machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression us-
ing the Confusion Metrics and Sea born. Furthermore, using met-
rics we will investigate why the classification accuracy for these
algorithms can be misleading.

## Used Technologies :
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy,
Sea Born, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
